In this assignment I refreshed my knowledge of Arduino and learned how to use analog output through pulse width modulation. My code makes an LED gradually brighten and dim from off to full brightness. It also prints how much power is going to the LED on the serial monitor.<br/>

For me, this assignment was a pleasant refresher and a good way to learn how to use a for statement.

In this assignment I used an LCD screen to print "hello world" and the amount of time since the code started. I used the LiquidCrystal library to make the LCD usable. One thing that I learned in this assignment was how to use the millis() function to keep time.

I didn't enjoy this assignment due to the tedious nature of wiring the LCD screen.
